* What is this?
  This repository contains my scripts and configuration files
  for various programs. I'm using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to manage it, so
  each directory will mimic the home directory in its structure.
  For example, my scripts in =~/.local/bin/= are symlinks from
  =dotfiles/scripts/.local/bin/=.
