* What is this?
  This repository contains my scripts and configuration files for
  various programs. I'm using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] to manage it, so each directory
  will mimic the home directory in its structure.  For example, my
  scripts in =~/.local/bin/= are symlinks from
  =dotfiles/scripts/.local/bin/=.
  
* Licensing
  These files are under the terms of the GNU General Public License
  v3.0, as written in [[./LICENSE][LICENSE]], unless a different license is specified
  in source code or license files in subdirectories.
